# 🧬 scRNA-seq Data

This repository includes scRNA-seq data capturing transcriptional dynamics during human adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) across developmental stages, for both control and amyloid-β (Aβ)-treated conditions. These data provide the foundation for exploring cell fate trajectories, differential gene expression.


# 📌 Experimental Conditions

Control: Untreated neural progenitor cells (NPCs)

Aβ-treated: NPCs exposed weekly to physiologically relevant amyloid-β 1-42


# 🗓 Developmental Time Points

Day 0: iPSC/NPC baseline

Day 7: Early differentiation

Day 13: NPC-to-neuroblast transition

Day 20: Neuronal maturation


# 📂 Data Availability

All raw and processed scRNA-seq data files are publicly available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO):

Accession: [GSE307094](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE307094)

No additional supplementary files are required for reusability.


# ⚡ Usage

These files can be directly used with standard scRNA-seq analysis tools such as Seurat, Scanpy, or Monocle for:

Cell type and trajectory analysis

Differential gene expression

Integration with scATAC-seq data
